# UserBased-RecommenderSystems

### Goal
The goal of this assignment is to familiarize you with the User-based Recommender System and also expose you to model evaluation on real data.

### What to do -- recommender.py
You are asked to complete a Python program, called `recommender.py` that will
* [Task 1] Calculate user similarity weights among users using four different metrics, including Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Pearson correlation, and Cosine similarity
* [Task 2] Use user similarity weights from top k users to predict movies ratings for selected users 
* [Task 3] Evaluate the performances of combinations of different metrics and different values of k
